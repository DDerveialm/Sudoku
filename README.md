# Sudoku

### my sudoku solver written in C++

　First time I wrote a program to solve a sudoku is 
in the course of program design 2. I was so impressed 
with how fast a computer is. 

　I'd not even heard STL until then, but now 
C++ is so fascinating to me. Thus, I keep maintaining 
this small project, trying to make code cleaner, 
more readable with proper technicques in C++.

　Maybe some fun stuff in the terminal will be developed 
in the future.
